Classify raw audio by musical genre with deep learning techniques.

The dataset used here is the GTZAN Genre Dataset which is available 
in two different places:
1) It can be found on the Marsyas (Music Analysis, Retrieval and Synthesis 
for Audio Signals) website here:
http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html
Click 'Download the GTZAN genre collection' to download this dataset.
2) The dataset was uploaded to kaggle and can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification.
Click download in the top left corner to download this dataset.

Note: When downloading from kaggle, 'jazz.00054.wav' is an invalid file. You must 
delete it from the data you download and manually replace it with the valid 
version found here:

The idea, methodology, and code for this project were inspired by Valerio
Velardo's youtube series titled 'Deep Learning (for audio) with Python'. This
tutorial series can be found here:

PS: This is my first github project.
